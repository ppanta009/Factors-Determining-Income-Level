Algorithm: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, K-means algorithm.

The issue with inequality in the income is a trending topic and generally gender has been determined as a key factor that influences the income level of an individual. Three machine learning algorithms have been developed to predict the variables that determines the income level of an individual. Na√Øve Bayes algorithm is found ineffective as the accuracy with the model is low i.e., 41%. The decision tree has been used to support the result provided by support vector machine. The accuracy of support vector machine is 76% which is acceptable regarding the nature of the data. The algorithms have been feed with standardised data and grid search algorithm has been performed to find the best parameter. The result shows that age, seniority and job title have significant role in determining the salary of an individual while age has insignificant effect.
